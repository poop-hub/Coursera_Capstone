    "Houston is a large and developed city. The city is located in Texas and has about 2 million inhabitants. There are a large number of neighbourhoods and venues in it. There are areas in which only rich people or only poor people live. Therefore, it is interesting to determine what type of store would be profitable to open in order to make a profit and where. "

    "In this project, we will investigate Houston for the possibility of opening a store and identify an approximate area in which to do so. The city is located in Texas and has about 2 million inhabitants. In the first step, we will collect data to describe the city at the district level. We will also collect data on venuses located in this city in order to determine where the density of vents is higher and there is a demand and an opportunity to discover a new one. Next, we will only work with data for all stores to determine the density of stores in the city and find a niche. Next, we will find common patterns between areas in order to determine the approximate contingent of our clients. We will use two types of clustering to make sure that the clusters reflect common patterns. For this, we use the KMeans and Agglomerative Clustering algorithms. Finally, we will narrow down the category of stores that can be opened in one of the districts of these clusters. We will then use the data for the wealthiest neighborhoods in the city to find neighborhoods where customers can afford to shop in our store. As a result, we will get the approximate location of the store and the type of store that have development prospects."
